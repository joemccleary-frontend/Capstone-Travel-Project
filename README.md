# Capstone - Travel Planning Project

This project is part of the Udacity nanodegree, the goal of it is to create an app that uses a number of API's to allow you to input a travel destination and departure date and it will return a few pieces of information in return.
The feature added to make my project stand out was the use of the REST Countries API.
